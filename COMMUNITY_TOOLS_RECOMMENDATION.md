# Community Tool Sharing Strategy for Recursive.eco

## Current Situation
- Zero users currently (per blog post: https://blog.jongu.org/1st-hour/)
- Previous version had community-contributed tools but was removed
- Ambivalent about being a "platform owner" vs "publisher" 
- Don't want to spend time moderating/curating
- Could potentially be a showcase for people who take your Claude tool-building course

## Recommendation: **Gradual Curator-First Approach**

### Phase 1: Personal Showcase (Current - 6 months)
**Status:** Publisher, not platform
- Keep the current model: only tools you create
- Focus on building 1-3 high-quality reference tools
- Document your creation process publicly (becomes course content)
- This establishes quality standards and your unique voice

### Phase 2: Selective Partnerships (6-12 months)
**Status:** Curated collective
- Invite 2-3 specific creators you respect (therapists, coaches you know personally)
- Create a simple submission process: GitHub PR + brief description
- Review and approve manually (low volume = manageable)
- Each contributor gets their own page/section with attribution
- Clear "Created by [Name]" badges on everything

### Phase 3: Course Graduate Showcase (12+ months)
**Status:** Educational platform
- People who complete your Claude tool-building course can submit tools
- Built-in quality filter (they learned your methods)
- Course fees help subsidize curation time
- Creates incentive loop: course → showcase → more course students

## Why This Approach Works

### Aligns With Your Values
- **Low maintenance:** Start small, grow only when you have capacity
- **Quality over quantity:** Hand-picked vs open-for-all
- **Educational mission:** Showcases become teaching examples
- **Recursive kindness:** Contributors share freely, everyone benefits

### Solves The Platform vs Publisher Dilemma
- You're not a "platform" (no algorithmic feeds, viral dynamics)
- You're not just a "publisher" (community voices included)
- You're a **curator** - closer to museum director than platform owner

### Revenue Model Integration
- Course graduates get showcase opportunity
- Drives course enrollment
- Contributors can link to their own services
- Everyone benefits without you needing to monetize the tools directly

## Implementation Details

### Quality Control (Minimal Overhead)
```markdown
Submission Requirements:
1. Must be a wellness/personal development tool
2. Must work without authentication
3. Must include clear instructions
4. Must credit methodologies/frameworks used
5. Creator provides brief bio + contact info
```

### Technical Implementation
- Simple folder structure: `/community-tools/creator-name/tool-name/`
- Each tool gets its own subdirectory
- Standardized format for attribution and descriptions
- Could even be managed via GitHub PRs (very low overhead)

## Decision Framework
**Start with Phase 1 for now because:**
1. You have zero users - focus on building audience first
2. Your time is better spent creating great examples
3. Quality showcase tools become marketing for your courses
4. You can always add community tools later when you have demand

**Move to Phase 2 when:**
- You have 100+ regular users
- 2-3 therapists/coaches reach out wanting to contribute
- You have clear success metrics for what "good tools" look like
- You have ~2 hours/month to spend on curation

## Bottom Line
Stay a **publisher** for now. The community tool sharing can wait until you have an actual community to serve. Your unique voice and high-quality examples are your competitive advantage - don't dilute that too early.

The recursive kindness principle applies here too: by creating excellent examples now, you're giving the community something valuable to build upon later.
